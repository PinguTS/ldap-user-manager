# LDAP User Manager

A PHP-based web interface for managing LDAP user accounts, organizations, and role-based access control. Designed to work with OpenLDAP and containerized deployments.

***

## Features

- **Setup Wizard**: Creates necessary LDAP structure and initial admin user
- **Organization Management**: Create, edit, and delete organizations (companies, universities, etc.)
- **Role-based Access Control**: Administrators, maintainers, organization managers, and regular users
- **User Management**: Create, edit, and delete user accounts with secure password generation
- **Group Management**: Create and manage LDAP groups
- **Self-service**: Users can manage their own accounts and change passwords
- **Email Integration**: Optional email notifications for new accounts and credential updates
- **Passcode Support**: Optional passcode attributes for additional authentication

***

## Quick Setup with Docker Compose

1. **Start LDAP server:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.ldap.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Start user manager:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.app.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Complete setup at `http://localhost:8080/setup/`**

The web-based setup wizard will automatically create all necessary LDAP structure, users, and roles.

## LDAP Requirements

LDAP User Manager works with standard OpenLDAP schemas and uses existing attributes for maximum compatibility:

- **Standard schemas**: core, cosine, inetorgperson, organization, locality
- **Role storage**: Uses LDAP groups with `groupOfNames` object class
- **Passcode storage**: Uses existing `userPassword` attribute for both passwords and passcodes
- **Compatibility**: Works with any LDAP server that supports standard schemas

For detailed LDAP setup instructions, see [LDAP-CONFIGURATION.md](LDAP-CONFIGURATION.md).

## Role-based Access Control

- **Administrators**: Full system access
- **Maintainers**: Can manage organizations and users
- **Organization Managers**: Manage users within their organization
- **Regular Users**: Self-service account management
